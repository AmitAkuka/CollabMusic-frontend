# CollabMusic-frontend

CollabMusic - a collaborative music application that allows listening and sharing of music.
Users can play songs for others by selecting a track and waiting for the contributor, vote on playing songs, engage in chat, and more.
Each user is represented in the room by an avatar reflecting their actions (playing a song - in the DJ position, dancing, and more).
